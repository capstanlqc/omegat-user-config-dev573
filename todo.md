# Steps

* Fix error in pisaconv.groovy when container is not PISA
* Fix pseudo-translate script in Arabic (tags are translated too)
* Fetch remote hashes file
* Fetch files that have a different hash
* If one of the fetched files is a plugin, ask user to close OmegaT now (recommended!)
* Add TmxCommentProvider to custom plugins
